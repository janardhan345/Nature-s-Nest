# Image placeholders

Please note that you'll need to replace these image placeholders with actual images for your "Nature's Nest" eco-luxury resort website. The following files should be added to the `/public/images/` directory:

1. `hero-bg.jpg` - A high-quality image of a nature resort for the hero background
2. `gallery-1.jpg` - Luxury eco-cottage with panoramic forest views
3. `gallery-2.jpg` - Sustainably designed pool area surrounded by nature
4. `gallery-3.jpg` - Open-air natural dining experience
5. `gallery-4.jpg` - Luxurious bedroom with organic materials
5. `gallery-5.jpg` - Peaceful meditation area in natural surroundings
6. `gallery-6.jpg` - Eco-resort exterior blending with the landscape
7. `testimonial-1.jpg` - Image of couple Emma & James
8. `testimonial-2.jpg` - Image of couple Sophie & Michael
9. `testimonial-3.jpg` - Image of couple Olivia & Liam

You can use stock photos or custom photography for these images. Make sure they align with the eco-luxury theme and maintain consistent quality and style across all images.
